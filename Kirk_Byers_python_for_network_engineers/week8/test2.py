#ways to import python module
#1 - brings module in and prepends "test."
#import test
#print test.a
#python would return "100"

#2
#from test import some_func
#some_func()
#python would return the execution of that function
#from test import a
#print a
#python would return "100"
	#slightly differently you can import as
	#import test as zzz
	#from test import some_func as zzz
